# Ensemble-ANFIS
Machine Learning price prediction of Indexes. Comparing ANFIS vs ARIMA and Hybrid SOM/ANFIS vs Ensemble ANFIS.


What the project does?
-Investiage a novel approach of ensemble ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System) against hybrid SOM(Self Organised Maps) ANFIS and traditional
ARIMA. Machine learning and traditional timeseries models as describe above are applied to Australian Indexes (All Ordinaries) for future price prediction.
 
Why the project is useful?
-Masters of Mathematics Thesis, extending current literature of machine learning models in financial predictions.

How users can get started with the project?
Matlab R2017b - (Machine Learning Models) ANFIS / SOM 
R-3.6.1 -  ARIMA and feature selection.

Where users can get help with your project?
Exenteding approach to different application and additional features such as inter-daily scales (i.e. hourly prices), sentiment analysis and other market data.
